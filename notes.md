My name is Laura Cegarra, I am 23 years old and I am a student of 1st year of programming.
Since I was a little girl I have liked computers and I have been learning little things together with my father about the Linux operating system.
One of my favorite hobbies is playing video games.
Today I am interested in many things, but most of all in space and the history of the Egyptians.
My favorite thing to do nowadays in the programming field is to create web pages and develop programs using C#.
